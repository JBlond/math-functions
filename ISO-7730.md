# ISO 7730 – PMV/PPD Calculation

This project implements the calculation of the **Predicted Mean Vote (PMV)** and the **Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD)** according to ISO 7730.
The values depend heavily on the input parameters:
- Air temperature
- Radiation temperature
- Air velocity
- Relative humidity
- Metabolic rate (*met*)
- Clothing value (*clo*).

## Reference values for tests

To model realistic scenarios, the following tables can be used:

### Typical clo values (clothing)

| Clothing / Outfit                      | clo value (approx.) |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Naked                                  | 0.0                 |
| Underwear                              | 0.1                 |
| Summer clothing (T-shirt + shorts)     | 0.3–0.4             |
| Light office attire (shirt + trousers) | 0.5                 |
| Office attire with jacket              | 0.7                 |
| Winter attire (sweater + jacket)       | 0.9–1.0             |
| Winter coat, scarf, hat                | 1.2–1.5             |

### Typical met values (activity)

| Activity                                   | met value (approx.) |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Sleeping                                   | 0.7                 |
| Quiet sitting / office work                | 1.0–1.2             |
| Standing, light movement                   | 1.4–1.6             |
| Walking (4 km/h)                           | 2.0                 |
| Walking (5–6 km/h)                         | 2.5–3.0             |
| Physical work (e.g., construction, sports) | 3.0–4.0             |
| Heavy work (e.g., intensive training)      | 5.0+                |

### Map PMV value to verbal thermal sensation according to ISO 7730

| Value | English      |Deutsch     |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| +3    | hot          |  heiß      |
| +2    | warm         | warm       |
| +1    |slightly warm | etwas warm |
| 0     | neutral      | neutral    |
| −1    | slightly cool| etwas kühl |
| −2    | cool         | kühl       |
| −3    | cold         | kalt       |

## Notes

clo describes the thermal resistance of the clothing.

met describes the metabolic rate (1 met ≈ 58.15 W/m²).

These values are approximate and are used to parameterize PMV/PPD calculations, according to ISO 7730.
